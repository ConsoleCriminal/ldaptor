The base DN for the search
==========================

A search filter, specifying criteria an entry must
fulfill to match.

Scope of the search, either look at the base DN only,
only look one level below it, or look at the whole subtree
rooted at the base DN.

Size limit of at most how many matching entries to
return.

Attributes to return, or none for all attributes the
matching entries happen to have.
