Status and History
==================

Ldaptor was created by Tommi Virtanen (tv42) who developed it during the years 2001-2008.
From 2007 and onwards mainly bug fixes were added, many contributed by Debian maintainers.
Development picked back up in 2014 by Bret Curtis (psi29a) with Tommi's consent and was migrated
to Twisted where it is a first-party Twisted library. Ldaptor can be found here:

`<https://github.com/twisted/ldaptor>`_

The LDAP client library functionality is in active use. It is stable and works very well.
