ldaptor (0.0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applications changes:
    - Make ldaptor-passwd actually follow it's usage. Defaults to
      changing password of the bind DN, if unspecified.
    - Make ldaptor-passwd Samba password changing more intelligent;
      instead of a Boolean, it's now a tristate option, with the new
      value "auto" checking for objectClass and setting the Samba
      password if and only if it sees the value sambaAccount there.
    - ldaptor-passwd now always changes all applicable passwords.
    - Hierarchical structure editing in ldaptor-webui is done, remove from
      TODO.
    - In ldaptor-webui change_password, don't make the DN a form
      field, there's no point in changing it at that time.
    - In ldaptor-webui, parse invalid base DNs and complain to user.
    - In ldaptor-webui, store DNs as DistinguishedNames, not as
      strings.
    - We fully support DNS SRV records now.
    - Add sample app bin/ldaptor-fetchschema, and notes on it's
      future direction. The current output looks ugly.

  * API changes:
    - LDAPObject.namingContext returns the naming context containing
      the LDAP object.
    - Deprecate LDAPModifyAttributes in LDAPObject, ldaptor-webui.
    - Add password changing support to LDAPObject.
    - LDAPModifyPassword is no longer used anywhere, remove it.
    - Add LDAPObject.items().
    - Add LDAPObject.fetch().
    - Support partial fetching in LDAPObject.fetch().
    - Add LDAPObject.setPassword_Samba().
    - Remove LDAPModifySambaPassword, it has no users anymore.
    - LDAPObject.setPassword() password setting now changes all
      applicable passwords automatically.
    - Remove LDAPModifyAttributes as obsolete.
    - "key in ldapobject" support, better iteration support for
      LDAPObject keys and key values.
    - Move authentication bits from ldaptor-webui main script to
      ldaptor.cred module.
    - Prevent removing attributes that are in the RDN of the object.
    - DistinguishedName now parses the actual values in DNs into
      attributetypes and values, and raises
      InvalidRelativeDistinguishedName for malformed RDNs.
    - Add preliminary support for LDAP object data content
      suggestions. Still need to implement a lot more hints and
      integrate into ldaptor-webui.
    - Add simple&stupid server-side support. Only knows bind/unbind
      and search, and all searches return no items.
    - Add LDIF parsing support.
    - Move ldaptor.protocols.ldap.ldapfilter to ldaptor.ldapfilter.
    - Split LDAP schema implementation into pure-ASCII parsing part
      and LDAP client remote schema fetching.
    - Rename the module that does LDAP schema fetching over the
      client connection to fetchschema, to better separate it from
      the ASCII schema parser.
    - Rename LDAPObject to LDAPEntry, that might be a bit more
      descriptive.

  * Refactorings to adapt to Ldaptor APIs:
    - Deleting LDAP object is now done via LDAPObject.delete().
    - Switch from ldapclient helpers to LDAPObjects in ldaptor-webui
      mass_change_password.
    - Change ldaptor-webui change_password to use
      LDAPObject.setPassword() instead of LDAPModifyPassword.
    - In ldaptor-passwd, use LDAPObject.setPassword_Samba() instead
      of LDAPModifySambaPassword.
    - Rewrite more code away from LDAPSearch.
    - Refactor ldaptor-ldap2passwd to use LDAPObjects.
    - Refactor ldaptor-webui add and delete to use LDAPObjects and
      DistinguishedNames more.
    - Modernize the ldap_parallelsearch.py example to use
      LDAPEntries.

  * Refactorings to adapt to Twisted APIs:
    - Authorizer.setApplication() has been obsoleted, apparently
      .setServiceCollection() does the same thing.
    - Use new-style maybeDeferred.
    - Switch from standard unittest to Twisted's trial. Also
      reorganized the package to match trial's expectations; that
      is, removed the lib/ dir.
    - Move from my own waitForDeferred to twisted's deferredResult,
      deferredError.
    - Rewrite the ldap_parallelsearch.py example to suit
      twisted.internet.protocol.ClientCreator and to not use global
      variables.

  * Refactorings to adapt to Python APIs:
    - Avoid using deprecated features of python.

  * Internal refactorings:
    - ldaptor-webui's Gadget() does not need or want the base DN; it
      asks it from the user.
    - Work towards running ldaptor-webui from an .rpy: add state
      serialization support, make serviceLocationOverride optional.

  * Bugfixes:
    - Use a python2.1 scope rules compatible lambda.
    - Add missing module ldapconnector to package
      ldaptor.protocols.ldap's __all__ list.
    - Make LDAPSearchRequest inherit BERSequence so that it has a
      comparison function.
    - Make sure the other dn is not just a string in
      DistinguishedName.contains().
    - Fix broken test and implementation for
      LDAPObject.setPassword() -- used to change the password for the
      bind DN.
    - Be more explicit by stringifying DNs before trying to do
      string-like operations on them.
    - Avoid requesting LDAPIdentities before the necessary LDAP
      connection has opened.

  * Cleanups:
    - Cleanup unit tests and merge similar functionality into helper
      functions.
    - Remove unintelligible comments in md4.py.
    - Avoid non-ASCII in source (but still keep it in the test).
    - Add unit tests for NT password hashing.
    - Add test for LDAPObject.keys().
    - Clean up LDAPObject journal handling. Rename journal operation
      classes, provide a superclass to inherit, and give
      LDAPAttributeSet a real API to submit changes.
    - Actually call fail.getErrorMessage, don't just print the
      function.

  * Packaging:
    - Depend on twisted >= 1.0.6
    - Change Debian section for python{,2.1,2.2}-ldaptor from
      interpreters to python.

  * Administrivia:
    - API documentation:
      - Support setting PYTHONPATH outside the script (to use CVS
        Twisted).
      - New home page URL.
      - Support uploading the API docs.
    - Ignore editor backup files.
    - Ignore Twisted tap files.
    - Fix admin/doctest-all.py that got broken in the lib/
      reorganization.

ldaptor (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOTE: Requires a CVS version of twisted!
  * NOTE: Upgrade from 0.0.1 can fail.
  * Split package into library, ldaptor-webui and
    ldaptor-utils. Support multiple python versions in library.
  * Added new command line utilities:
    - ldaptor-namingcontexts to list naming contexts of a server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2dhcpconf is the start of a tool to export host
      entries from LDAP in a format suitable for a DHCP server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2maradns does pretty much the same for DNS, in
      (partial) maradns zone format; it was just so much easier.
    - note that the ldaptor-ldap2{dhcpconf,maradns} input format
      will change as I try to cram in a few more features
      (separate physical network location from DNS domain -- they
      are currently bound together).
    - ldaptor-search aims to be a full replacement for ldapsearch.
    - ldaptor-passwd allows changing passwords (as per RFC3062).

    - fix navi links.

    twisted.protocols.protocol to twisted.internet.protocol.
  * Handle unsolicited LDAP notifications.
  * New test subsystem.
  * Rewrite LDAP protocol error number storage to be
    bi-directional; you can resolve a number to a string.
