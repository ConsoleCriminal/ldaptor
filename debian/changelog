ldaptor (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * ldaptor-passwd generated password setting failed as it tried
    to handle a list of one string as a string.
  * Depend on pwgen.
  * Add change_password.
  * Rename mass_password_change to mass_change_password, to fit
    the task-oriented naming convention.
  * Don't accept empty passwords in ldaptor-webui change_password.
  * Get rid of the rest of the implicit localhosts.
  * Moving bidirdict into ldaptor package as distutils can't
    handle it otherwise.
  * Added asText method for LDAPFilter_substrings, webui search
    should no longer fail.
  * LDAPClient.bind() now returns a Deferred.
    LDAPClient.handle_bind_success() and
    LDAPClient.handle_bind_fail() are gone.
  * LDAPClient.bind() deferred bugfixes.
  * Added ability to use shorthands for Identity names.
  * Lots of minor bugfixes.

ldaptor (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOTE: Requires a CVS version of twisted!
  * NOTE: Upgrade from 0.0.1 can fail.
  * Split package into library, ldaptor-webui and
    ldaptor-utils. Support multiple python versions in library.
  * Added new command line utilities:
    - ldaptor-namingcontexts to list naming contexts of a server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2dhcpconf is the start of a tool to export host
      entries from LDAP in a format suitable for a DHCP server.
    - ldaptor-ldap2maradns does pretty much the same for DNS, in
      (partial) maradns zone format; it was just so much easier.
    - note that the ldaptor-ldap2{dhcpconf,maradns} input format
      will change as I try to cram in a few more features
      (separate physical network location from DNS domain -- they
      are currently bound together).
    - ldaptor-search aims to be a full replacement for ldapsearch.
    - ldaptor-passwd allows changing passwords (as per RFC3062).
  * ldaptor-webui:
    - added support for "Advanced" searching with raw LDAP filter
      strings.
    - change parameter --port to --http-port, for clarity.
    - fix navi links.
  * Make all LDAP server, port and base settings explicit.
  * Add ldapfilter and ldif modules.
  * Create ldaptor.usage to store common option processing.
  * Change twisted.python.defer to twisted.internet.defer and
    twisted.protocols.protocol to twisted.internet.protocol.
  * Handle unsolicited LDAP notifications.
  * New test subsystem.
  * Rewrite LDAP protocol error number storage to be
    bi-directional; you can resolve a number to a string.
